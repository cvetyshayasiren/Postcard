On a misty morning, sly as can be
She, the fox with fur as red as the sea
She prowls the fields with a glint in her eye
Searching for prey, ready to pounce and fly

And when the dawn breaks, she slips away
Back to her den, to rest and to play
But in the land of High Hopes, she'll return
A symbol of freedom, forever to yearn.

This Fox is pleasing 
This Fox a dancing
With friends sourround you.
Forever and ever.
